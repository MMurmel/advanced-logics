\chapter{Introduction}
These are my lecture notes for the lecture "Advanced Logics" held by Prof. Dr. Christel Baier at TU Dresden in the summer semester 2021.
They are meant to be a support in preparation for an oral exam.
Therefore it is not my goal to be as precise as the lecture script,
but rather summarize it and highlight important results.
Whenever details are left out,
I will try to reference the corresponding position in the script by the icon on the right.
\see{p. 0}
The first number will be the number of the lecture and everything following the page.
