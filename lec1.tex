\chapter{Introduction}
These are my lecture notes for the lecture "Advanced Logics" held by Prof. Dr. Christel Baier at TU Dresden in the summer semester 2021.
They are meant to be a support in preparation for an oral exam.
Therefore it is not my goal to be as precise as the lecture script,
but rather summarize it and highlight important results.
Whenever details are left out,
I will try to reference the corresponding position in the script by the icon on the right.
\see{p. 0}
The first number will be the number of the lecture and everything following the page.

\section{FOL in nutshell}
\subsection{Syntax of FOL}
A vocabulary of FOL is a tuple $\var{Voc} = \left( \var{Pred}, \var{Func} \right)$,
where $\var{Pred} = ( \var{Pred}_n)_{n \geq 1}$ and $\var{Func} = ( \var{Func}_m)_{m \geq 0}$ are pairwise disjoint families of predicate and function symbols
for every arity $n$ and $m$.
We often write $\var{Const}$ for $\var{Func}_0$, call its elements constant symbols,
and identify $\var{Pred} \coloneqq \bigcup_{n \geq 1} \var{Pred}_n$ and $\var{Func} \coloneqq \bigcup_{m \geq 1} \var{Func}_m$.
A vocabulary is called relational iff $\var{Func}_m = \emptyset$ for all $m \geq 1$ and purely relational iff $\var{Func} = \emptyset$.

Variables are elements of some infinite countable set $\var{Var}$.

\begin{definition}[Terms]
	We define FOL terms over some vocabulary $\var{Voc}$ inductively:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $x$ is a term for every $x \in \var{Var}$
		\item if $t_1, \ldots, t_m$ are terms, then so is $f(t_1, \ldots, t_m)$ for every $f \in \var{Func}_m$ and some $m \in \N$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Formulas]
	FOL formulas are also defined inductively:
	Let $x \in \var{Var}$, $P \in \var{Pred}_n$ for some $n \in \N$ and $t_1, \ldots, t_n$ be terms.
	Then the following are FOL formulas (or formulas for short):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\var{true}$
		\item $P(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$
		\item $\phi_1 \land \phi_2$
		\item $\neg \phi$
		\item $\forall x.\phi$
		\item $t_1 = t_2$ (optional)
	\end{itemize}
	where $\phi, \phi_1, \phi_2$ are also FOL formulas.
\end{definition}
